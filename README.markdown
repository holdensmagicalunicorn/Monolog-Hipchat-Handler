Install it and use it like any other monolog handler.

The repository contains an example file called "example.php", you can use it like this :

    $ php example.php <token_api> <room_id>
    
## Use it in an existing Symfony2 application ##

As you may know, monolog is the offical logging library for Symfony2. The cool thing is you can plug this handler to your Symfony2 application.
